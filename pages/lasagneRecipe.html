            <dl>
                <dt>
                    <li> Beef mince:  </li>
                </dt>
                <dd> it would hardly be a classic family favourite lasagne without a rich, ground beef mince sauce. Beef
                    mince is ideal for bulking up a lasagne and adding protein to the dish. Our Recipes Editor Sonya
                    Gellert has also made this recipe using plant-based mince, and declared it a delicious success..

                <dt>
                    <li> Italian diced tomatoes:  </li>
                </dt>
                <dd> a double duty ingredient, Italian diced tomatoes bring both moisture and added flavour to your meat
                    sauce. We love how this simple pantry staple does so much heavy lifting in this recipe.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt>
                    <li> Tomato paste: </li>
                </dt>
                <dd> while we use lots of simple ingredients to bring flavour to this recipe (think onion, garlic, a
                    splash of dry red wine and seasonings), for us tomato paste is a non-negotiable. It's an instant
                    umami-bomb and a little goes a long way.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt>
                    <li> Fresh lasagne sheets:  </li>
                </dt>
                <dd>we think fresh is best when it comes to lasagne sheets, but if you only have dried lasagne sheets,
                    you can pre-cook your pasta sheets to soften them (following packet directions) before cooking. This
                    will ensure your pasta isn't raw and crunchy. In our recipe notes, we have suggestions for other
                    layers you can use instead of pasta too.

                <dt>
                    <li> Mozzarella:  </li>
                </dt>
                <dd>what would a baked lasagne be without the golden brown top and cheesy pull? We use a dry mozzarella
                    (and coarsely grate a block), rather than fresh, wetter mozzarella, to ensure that magic pull moment
                    and a signature, alluring topping.

            <blockquote>Heat the 2 tsp olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the 1 brown onion, halved,
                finely chopped and 2 garlic cloves, crushed and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens.
                Add the 750g Carbon Neutral Beef Mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for
                5 minutes or until mince changes colour. Add the 2 x 400g cans Italian diced tomatoes, 125ml (1/2 cup)
                dry red wine and 55g (1/4 cup) tomato paste, and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer,
                uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat.
                Taste and season with Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
