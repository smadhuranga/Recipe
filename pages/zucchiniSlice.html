                </h2>
                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
                <blockquote>While the argument as to what is Australia's national dish will always rage (is it roast
                    lamb,
                    green chicken curry or a barramundi burger)? One thing is for sure, zucchini slice is hands-down the
                    national food of the home cook. Your lamb, barra and curry may turn up on the menu of a restaurant,
                    but
                    our favourite savoury slice never will. It's too humble. It just moseys its way into lunch boxes,
                    dinners and even canapes. There's a reason zucchini slice is taste.com.au's most popular recipe of
                    all
                    time - it's simpler than a quiche, tastier than an omelette, and it just works.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>zucchini slice is one of those recipes that ticks all the boxes in one go, and thanks to the
                        addition of 5 eggs, you get plenty of protein in this dinner-turned-lunchbox-leftovers slice.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>to ensure the zucchini slice isn't too pancake-like, we use a cup of self-raising flour to
                        create a
                        little height and a satisfying, not-too-dense texture.

                        <li> Zucchini: </li>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>the namesake vegetable star, zucchini (approximately 4 medium-large zucchinis makes up the 375g)
                        shines in this slice. To make sure your mixture isn't too wet, try squeezing some of the
                        moisture
                        out of the grated zucchini (you can use a clean cloth, or just your hands to try to remove some
                        of
                        the liquid. A little moisture is welcome in the batter though, so no need to wring it all out.
                        To
                        save time, we use the grating plate on our food processor to grate the zucchini.

                    <dt>
                        <li> Onion: </li>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>while we generally use a brown onion for this recipe, you can certainly substitute for a red
                        onion
                        to bring extra flavour to the zucchini slice.

                    <dt>
                        <li> Bacon: </li>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>the salty deliciousness and colour of bacon plays an important supporting role in zucchini
                        slice.
                        Our Recipes Editor, Sonya Gellert, has also tested the recipe using plant-based 'bacon'
                        (sometimes
                        called 'facon') and tells us it also works well, if you want to make a vegetarian zucchini
                        slice.

                        <li> Cheddar: </li>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>grated cheddar cheese makes this slice all the more, well, moreish. For a budget-friendly hack,
                        we
                        buy a block of cheese (which is often more affordable than pre-grated) and grate it ourselves.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <li> Vegetable oil: </li>
                    </dt>
                    <dd> this clever ingredient ensures your slice is one that won't dry out quickly, and will have a
                        deliciously moist texture
