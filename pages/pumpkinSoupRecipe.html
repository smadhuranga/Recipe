                recip</h2>
            <p>
            <blockquote>The recipe author, Valli Little, originally created this creamy pumpkin soup recipe way back in
                2004 and it was passed on to us here at taste.com.au as one of the first pumpkin soup recipes we ever
                published online. Since then, it’s become one of the most popular creamy pumpkin soup recipes in
                Australia, with more than 350 rave reviews to date.
                It’s creamy without being heavy, delicately spiced without being spicy, and hearty without being too
                rich. Pretty much everything we look for in a pumpkin soup (and we’ve tried a lot of pumpkin soup
                recipes over the years!).

                </dt>
                <dd>Because pumpkin really is the hero (no surprises there!) it's best to pick your pumpkin wisely. We
                    Originally made this pumpkin soup recipe with butternut pumpkin (or butternut squash for our
                    international readers), but kent (or jap) pumpkin also works well. The Taste Test Kitchen team
                    advises against some of the rarer types of pumpkin as they may give more watery results.

                </dt>
                <dd> While it can be tempting to skip the coriander, cumin and nutmeg, they really do bring warmth and
                    flavour to this pumpkin soup. If you haven't matched pumpkin and nutmeg in a recipe before, it
                    really is a revelation!

                <br>
                <dt>
                    <li> Onion and leek:</li>
                </dt>
                <dd>To get the most out of this creamy pumpkin soup, ensure you soften the onion and leek until they
                    just start to release some of their juices and flavours, but don’t go so far as to let them
                    caramelise. This gives the soup a subtle sweetness of flavour without any bitterness.

                <br>
                <dt>
                    <li> Cream:</li>
                </dt>
                <dd>While some recipes use coconut milk, in this pumpkin soup recipe we use thin cream instead of
                    coconut milk to achieve a luscious consistency.

                    <li> Potato:</li>
                </dt>
                <dd>The ultimate thickener in so many soups, adding a potato really amps up the heartiness of your
                    pumpkin soup.

                    <li> Stock:</li>
                </dt>
                <dd>A good quality stock has the power to elevate almost any soup. In this recipe, we recommend either
                    chicken or vegetable stock
