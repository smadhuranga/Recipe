            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;""> What makes this our best fried rice recipe? </h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
           In this super simple egg fried rice recipe we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of
                basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have
                on hand at any given time.
                The real secret here is to use a large fry pan or wok on a very high heat so the rice is fried and
                golden, rather than steamed or gluggy. Cooking it this way ensures the fried rice still has bite and
                absorbs the lovely flavours of the bacon and soy, without resembling a risotto!

                    </dt>
                    <dd>Your fried rice will turn out best if you use cold, long-grain rice (like jasmine rice). It's
                        really important to properly cool the rice down so if you're in a rush and just cooked the rice,
                        spread it thinly on a tray, cover loosely with some cling wrap and pop in the fridge until cool.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>We usually use whatever soy sauce is on hand, but of course you can use gluten-free soy sauce
                        (tamari) or low-sodium soy sauce instead and still create a flavourful fried rice.

                    <dd>A good neutral vegetable oil works best for frying, but you can add sesame for added flavour, if
                        you like.

                    <dd>While we do think the bacon really helps the flavours in this dish, if you don't have it to
                        hand, we have used ham as an alternative.

                    <dd>frozen peas that have been thawed beforehand works best.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>We form an omelette with the eggs to mix through our fried rice, but you could always create a
                        scrambled eggs texture, if you prefer.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>Don't be tempted to skip these. They add colour, flavour and texture. If you've got a fussy
                        eater in your household, you can dial them back a touch, but they really do help round out the
                        flavours of the dish.

                    </dt>
                    <dd> Have some sesame oil and oyster sauce on hand? Brilliant! (We've listed vegetable oil here, but
                        sesame oil brings extra flavour to your plate, as does a splash of oyster sauce or fish sauce).
                        A great way to use up leftover veggies and protein, fried rice recipes can be bolstered with
                        plenty of healthy ingredients and can easily be made vegetarian or vegan.
